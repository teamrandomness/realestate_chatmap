Where only a small fraction of the history of what it was and the potential of what it can be are inadequately summed up in a brief description. Well folks, this is that property!    Sitting on just under 2.9 acres of secluded land, this massive parcel has the unusual quality of providing both privacy and seclusion without that lonely feeling of utter isolation. Boasting incredible views of the Cleveland National Forest, this property begs you to get lost in the majestic surrounding landscapes and the picturesque rolling hills. But don't worry, you're not in the middle of nowhere! In fact, a quick 30 minute drive puts you right in the heart of downtown San Diego (traffic permitting of course). It is this unique blend of rural living and modern conveniences that has made the city of Alpine an attractive destination for those seeking a peaceful lifestyle but never want to be too far from the hustle and bustle, if that's what tickles your fancy!    As if the land and the location weren't unique enough, how about a 7,384 square foot home? You're not going to find many of those around here, that's for sure! And while the home could definitely use some TLC, the bones are there for something beyond amazing. Looking to relive memories from your youth, of visiting the relatives who had that ultra warm and cozy home? Was there a special place that you and your family spent the holidays? If that's what you've been searching for, then your search just might be over! While this massive home does need a little elbow grease to restore it back to the glory of its yester-years, this could easily be the home that everyone dreams of coming to for the holidays or for summer vacation! There's an incredibly designed pool (empty & not currently in use) on the property, and bringing it back into shape could create wonderful future memories for kids and grandkids! And if you're looking to put your own stamp on your next home, then this is perfect! Since it needs some upkeep and maintenance anyway, why not use this opportunity to make this 7,000+ square foot house the home you have always dreamed about?   Don't wait... no, seriously, DO NOT WAIT! Opportunities like this are rare, and locations like this are special. Spend a little time here, and allow yourself to dream big. The options are endless. Or at least, bound only by the limits of your own imagination.</td><td>https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/617-Victoria-Knolls-Dr-Alpine-CA-91901/16902847_zpid/</td></tr><tr><td>33714</td><td>Saint Petersburg</td><td>FL</td><td>-82.65579</td><td>27.80875</td><td>4009 17th St N</td><td>565.01205198</td><td>0.15821117451465022</td><td>FOR_SALE</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>497700</td><td>1953</td><td>SINGLE_FAMILY</td><td>1268</td><td>sqft</td><td>2600</td><td>USD</td><td>USA</td><td>125500</td><td>MOVE IN READY!!!

         "Every once in a while, a property comes along that is so unique, so special, that describing it is next to impossible. Where only a small fraction of the history of what it was and the potential of what it can be are inadequately summed up in a brief description. Well folks, this is that property!    Sitting on just under 2.9 acres of secluded land, this massive parcel has the unusual quality of providing both privacy and seclusion without that lonely feeling of utter isolation. Boasting incredible views of the Cleveland National Forest, this property begs you to get lost in the majestic surrounding landscapes and the picturesque rolling hills. But don't worry, you're not in the middle of nowhere! In fact, a quick 30 minute drive puts you right in the heart of downtown San Diego (traffic permitting of course). It is this unique blend of rural living and modern conveniences that has made the city of Alpine an attractive destination for those seeking a peaceful lifestyle but never want to be too far from the hustle and bustle, if that's what tickles your fancy!    As if the land and the location weren't unique enough, how about a 7,384 square foot home? You're not going to find many of those around here, that's for sure! And while the home could definitely use some TLC, the bones are there for something beyond amazing. Looking to relive memories from your youth, of visiting the relatives who had that ultra warm and cozy home? Was there a special place that you and your family spent the holidays? If that's what you've been searching for, then your search just might be over! While this massive home does need a little elbow grease to restore it back to the glory of its yester-years, this could easily be the home that everyone dreams of coming to for the holidays or for summer vacation! There's an incredibly designed pool (empty & not currently in use) on the property, and bringing it back into shape could create wonderful future memories for kids and grandkids! And if you're looking to put your own stamp on your next home, then this is perfect! Since it needs some upkeep and maintenance anyway, why not use this opportunity to make this 7,000+ square foot house the home you have always dreamed about?   Don't wait... no, seriously, DO NOT WAIT! Opportunities like this are rare, and locations like this are special. Spend a little time here, and allow yourself to dream big. The options are endless. Or at least, bound only by the limits of your own imagination.",

         "This real log cabin, both rustic and fine, looks through pines at the south end of Long Lake and Owl's Head Mountain. Outdoor living is enjoyable in any season; sit on either deck in good weather, or relax in the hot tub on the screen porch in the dead of winter, and watch the snowfall. (The owner will miss that.) Cozy inside, this cabin is warm and inviting, clean and livable, with high-grade appliances, cabinets, and fixtures. Much of the well-chosen furniture is included. Stay warm with an easy-to-run wood stove but trust your cabin with propane wall heaters and a standby generator if you're away. The seller's pride of ownership shows throughout, and the decision to sell was not easy, but nothing lasts forever. Where do you want to spend your time?",

A shed in the backyard can be useful for storage or as a workshop. The backyard is private, offering a quiet and secluded space. The home is described as structurally sound but in need of some tender loving care (TLC). This suggests that there may be some maintenance or renovation required. The area offers numerous opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts with three major rivers nearby. These rivers likely provide opportunities for hunting, camping, fishing, and other outdoor activities. There are archery and gun ranges nearby for those interested in shooting sports. The beaches are approximately one and a half hours away, which could make for a great day trip or weekend getaway. The Jacksonville International Airport is about a two-hour drive away, providing convenient access to air travel. The major interstates are around one hour away, facilitating easy travel to other parts of the region. The community is primarily engaged in farming and logging, indicating a rural and possibly tight-knit community. This description provides a good overview of the property and its surroundings, making it suitable for someone who enjoys a rural lifestyle with access to outdoor activities and the convenience of nearby airports and interstates.",

         "Midloch Farm is situated at the center of the Green Springs Historic District, which is one of the most protected scenic areas in all Virginia. The 200 acre, mostly open property has not been available in over 50 years. The 1885 late Victorian farm house sits on a high point over looking pastoral, and mountain views.  Improvements include the 3 bedrooms, and 2 baths manor house, which retains much of its original details such as wooden floors, mantels, transoms, and doors. Close to the main house are two cottages, a 1920 guest house with 2 bedrooms, and a 1790 cottage, ideal as a studio, or office.. Farm buildings include two barns, equipment/garage shed, and garden shed. A rare opportunity to own a significant farm in a protected area, with a view that will never change. Property is protected by a conservation easement. Seller will consider owner financing for qualified buyers.",
